MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing web applications. In this pattern, the application is divided into three interconnected components:

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, database interactions, and business rules. In a Node.js application, this might involve interacting with a database using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like Sequelize or Mongoose.

View: The View is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting the data to the users. It receives data from the Model and displays it to the user. In web applications, views are often implemented using HTML templates combined with template engines like Handlebars, Pug, or EJS.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, processes it (possibly involving interactions with the Model), and decides which View to render. In a Node.js application, controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, execute the corresponding business logic, and return an appropriate HTTP response. Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, is often used to implement controllers.
